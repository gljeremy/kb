1. Query Enhancements
	- Supplement AI models to extract intent, entities, and context from user queries
	- **Semantic Search**: Leverage AI to understand the meaning behind search queries rather than relying solely on keyword matching (e.g., Word2Vec, FastText) to capture semantic relationships between words.
2. **Image and Video Search** and PDFs (image based)
    - Extend search capabilities to include images and videos.
    - Implement AI models for image recognition, object detection, and content-based image retrieval.
    - Image categorization 
3. Extract keywords and entities from a document 
2. **Personalization**:
    - Utilize AI to personalize search results based on user behavior, preferences, and historical interactions.
    - Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and reinforcement learning can enhance personalization.
3. **Entity Recognition and Linking**:
    - Use AI to identify and link entities (e.g., people, places, products) within search results.

4. **Feedback Loop**
5. **Ranking Algorithms**:
